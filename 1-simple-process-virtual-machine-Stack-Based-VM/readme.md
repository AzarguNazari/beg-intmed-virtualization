## Overview

This project implements a stack-based virtual machine (VM) that can execute a custom bytecode instruction set. The VM provides fundamental operations for stack manipulation and arithmetic operations.

## Features

- Stack-based execution model
- Basic instruction set including:
    - Stack operations (PUSH, POP)
    - Arithmetic operations (ADD, SUBTRACT)
    - Control flow (JUMP)
- Memory management system
- Instruction decoder

## Technical Details

### Core Components

1. **Stack Management**
    - Push and pop operations
    - Stack pointer handling
    - Stack bounds checking

2. **Instruction Set**
    - Basic arithmetic operations
    - Stack manipulation instructions
    - Control flow instructions

3. **Memory System**
    - Managed memory space
    - Safe memory access
