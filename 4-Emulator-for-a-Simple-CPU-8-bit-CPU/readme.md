# CPU Emulator Project

## Overview
This project involves creating an emulator for a simple 8-bit CPU (such as 6502 or a custom instruction set). The emulator implements fundamental CPU operations and serves as a learning tool for understanding computer architecture.

## Features
The emulator supports basic CPU instructions including:
- Load
- Store
- Add
- Branch operations

## Learning Objectives
Through this project, you will gain understanding of:

### Computer Architecture
- CPU architecture fundamentals
- Instruction execution cycle
- Basic computer operations

### System Concepts
- Emulation principles
- Virtualization basics

### Programming Concepts
- Structs
- Arrays
- Instruction decoding using switch-case statements

## Technical Stack
- Programming Language: C
