# Virtual File System Project

## Overview
A virtual file system (VFS) implementation that simulates file operations in a contained environment. This system provides functionality for creating, reading, writing, and deleting files, all managed within memory or persisted as a single file on the host system.

## Project Description
The project aims to create a virtual file system that:
- Operates in memory or as a single file
- Supports basic file operations (CRUD)
- Simulates a real file system environment

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding file system fundamentals
    - Inode structure
    - Block management
    - Directory organization
- Storage virtualization concepts
- Core C Programming concepts:
    - File I/O operations
    - Data structures implementation
        - Linked lists
        - Trees
    - Memory management principles
