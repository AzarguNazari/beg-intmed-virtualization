# Virtual Memory Manager Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a simple virtual memory manager that simulates paging and address translation using a fixed-size page table to map virtual addresses to physical addresses.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding virtual memory concepts:
    - Page tables
    - Page faults
    - Memory virtualization fundamentals
- Practicing C programming concepts:
    - Pointers
    - Dynamic memory allocation
    - Bitwise operations

## Technical Focus
The implementation focuses on demonstrating the core mechanisms of:
- Virtual-to-physical address translation
- Page table management
- Memory paging simulation
