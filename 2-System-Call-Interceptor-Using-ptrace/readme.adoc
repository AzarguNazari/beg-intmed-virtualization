A tool for intercepting and logging system calls using ptrace, similar to strace.

== How to run it?
```shell
./run.sh
```


== Description

This project implements a system call interceptor that:

* Uses the `ptrace` syscall to monitor process execution
* Logs system calls made by a target process
* Provides optional functionality to restrict specific system behaviors

== Learning Objectives

=== System Fundamentals
* Understanding system calls in Linux environments
* Process-level virtualization and isolation concepts

=== Core Technical Concepts
* System call implementation and interception
* Process management
* Signal handling
* Using the `ptrace` system call

== Features
* System call monitoring and logging
* Process tracking
* Optional behavior restriction capabilities

== Technical Requirements
* C programming language
* Linux environment
* `ptrace` syscall support

== Educational Value
This project provides hands-on experience with:

* Low-level system programming
* Process monitoring and control
* System call manipulation
